# ü§ù Contribution guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Scitizen üî¨.

It is people like you that make Scitizen such a great project üöÄ.

## üìò Getting familiar with the project architecture

In order to get familiar with the architecture behind Scitizen, please read our [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) guide.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developing on a local device

The best way to extensively test the behavior of Scitizen is to test it directly on a physical device (like a Raspberry Pi).

In order to develop on a local device, follow these steps üëá

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup your repository

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install `balena-cli`

You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ List all device types that are supported

Run the command

```bash
balena devices supported
```

Example of output

v2.71.5+rev1.prod
v2.71.5+rev1.dev
v2.71.3+rev1.prod
v2.71.3+rev1.dev
```

Then, find the latest development version (.dev) version (in our example, we'll take `v2.80.5+rev1.dev`).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Download the latest development version (.dev) available for your device

Run the command

```bash
balena os download raspberrypi4-64 --output scitizen-os-dev.img --version v2.80.5+rev1.dev

```

In `Device Hostname`, fill in `scitizen`.
If you need Wi-Fi, you can also set it up here.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Plug-in your micro-SD card and find the drive

Run the command

```bash
balena util available-drives
```

Example of output

```bash
DEVICE     SIZE    DESCRIPTION

```

In our example, the drive is `/dev/disk2`.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Flash the image

Run the command

```bash
sudo balena local flash scitizen-os-dev.img --drive /dev/disk2
```

Example of output

```bash
? This will erase the selected drive. Are you sure? Yes

In our example, the device hostname is `scitizen.local`.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Push Scitizen on your device and start a live session

Run the command

```bash
balena push scitizen.local
```

Example of output

```

Congratulations üéâ! You now have a live session where every changes you apply on the code will be build and pushed to your device.

### Optional: connect to your device via SSH

To connect to the Host OS, run the command

```bash
balena ssh scitizen.local
```

To connect to a specific service, run the command

```bash
balena ssh scitizen.local <service>
```

Example: `balena ssh scitizen.local app`

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developing without a local device

It is also possible to contribute to Scitizen even if you do not have access to a physical device like a Raspberry Pi.

We will use a container image to emulate the Host OS.

In order to develop without a local device, follow these steps üëá

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup your repository

You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Emulate Scitizen Host OS

Run the command

```bash
docker run \
--name scitizen_os \
--detach \
--interactive \
--tty \
--privileged \
--network host \
--restart always \
--tmpfs /run,/run/lock,/tmp,/var/lib/journal,/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd \
